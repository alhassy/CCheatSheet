+ C is a mid-level language that has the capability to examine memory and the variables
  stored there.

:Nope:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
enum days {SUN = 1, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT};
// Automatically: MON = 2, TUE = 3, ‚Ä¶.
#+END_SRC
:End:

:EmacsSetup:

See [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-C.html][here]] for working with C/C++/D code blocks in Org mode;
which includes examples and header argument configurations.

+ If a main method is not present in a code block then the entire block is wrapped in a trivial main function call.

+ If you want to see the expanded source code, without compiling and running it, just type C-c C-v v.

:var VARIABLE=VALUE
A global C, C++, or D variable named VARIABLE will be declared and initialized with VALUE

Possible types for VARIABLE may be:

int,
double,
string or const char*,
type[]    // type = int, double, string, const char*
type[][]  // type = int, double, string, const char*
The later type, type[][], is used for variables storing Org tables

The type[] is used for lists or vectors declared in the header.

+ ~:cmdline~ ::
    command line arguments to pass to the executable compiled from the code block.

+ ~:flags~ :: flags to pass to the compiler.

+ ~:main~ ::
        can be set to "no" to inhibit wrapping of the code block in a main function call.

+ ~:includes~ :: accepts either a single string name, or a list of names of files to #include in the execution of the code block.

+ ~:defines~ :: just like :includes but for #defines lines at the top of the code.

+ ~:libs~ :: useful for linking with a library, may be given -L/path/to/lib and -llibrary instructions.

There is no support for sessions:
As opposed to interpreted languages, which can be evaluated directly, C, C++, and D code is first compiled to an executable which is then run.
However, /An Interactive Way to C/ does provide support for sessions by using the ~currently-working-with~ mechanism (‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó‚Ä¢ÃÅ)Ÿà

+ There is no directive like ~#include "stdio.h"~ because those libraries are so common that they are always included.

+ Variables may be declared outside the script. They are automatically inserted at the top of the script.

#+NAME: nice
| English | Arabic |
|---------+--------|
| zero    | sifr   |
| one     | wahid  |
| two     | ithnan |

#+header: :var mystring="Sunday" :var myint=145 :var mydouble=3.14 :var T=nice
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  // T is decared as a char*  [][] array with helpers: T_rows, T_cols, T_header, and accessor function T_h(row, col). Press C-c C-v v to see these generated names ;-)
  printf ("mystring %s\n", mystring);
  printf ("myint    %d\n", myint);
  printf ("mydouble %g\n", mydouble);
  printf ("%s %s", T_h(1, "English"), T_h(1, "Arabic") );

  // When an org table only consists of numbers, then it will be typed double[][],
  // otherwise tables are always strings, to convert a string to a numeric value, use C's atoi.
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| mystring | Sunday |
| myint    |    145 |
| mydouble |   3.14 |
| one      |  wahid |

generated code visualization through C-c C-v v is super cool.

  #+RESULTS:

* Adminstriva

  + All C programs consist of a series of /functions/, which have return values!

  + E.g., Assignment ~x = v~ is the function that updates the value of name ~x~
    with the value of ~v~ then terminates yielding ~v~ as a return value.

  + Semicolons act as statement /terminators/ ---in contrast to English,
    wherein they are /separators/.

  + C is whitespace agnostic: Newlines and arbitrary spaces don't matter, for the most part.
    # Every token could be on its own line if we want.

  + /Compound statements/ are formed from primitive statements by enclosing them in ~{~ curly braces ~}~.
    - Compounds may appear where-ever a single statement is allowed.

  + All keywords are in lowercase.

  + C comments do /not/ nest.
  + Include files personal files by enclosing them in "quotes", use <brackets> for
    standard library files.
  + /All/ statements must terminate with a semicolon.
  + Everything must be declared before it can be used ---sequential.
  + Characters are in-fact aliases for ASCII numerals.
    #+BEGIN_SRC C :exports results
    printf("'A' ‚âà %d  ‚â°  %s", 'A', 'A' == 65? "true" : "false");
    printf("\n'Z' ¬≠ 23  ‚âà  %c  ‚â°  %d", 'Z' - 23, 'Z' - 23);
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    | 'A' | ‚âà | 65 | ‚â° | true |   |    |
    | 'Z' | ¬≠ | 23 | ‚âà | C    | ‚â° | 67 |

  + C functions don't have to return anything if it's not appropriate.
    - E.g., ~exit(n)~ is the function that returns control to the operating system;
      passing it an argument ~n~, usually 0 if everything has gone smoothly and 1 if it's
      an error exit. Yet this function obviously' can't /return/ a value.

  + You must specify the type of a variable before you can use it.

  + A variable name is only meaningful in the curly brackets that define it,
    and is otherwise meaningless. This is its /scope/.
    - Whence, the same names can occur in different places to mean different things.
    - To transfer data between functions one thus uses parameter lists and return calls.

  + ~printf~, ‚Äúprint formatted‚Äù, is a /dependently-typed function/: The number and type
    of its arguments depends on its first argument, a string.
    + The number of occurrences of ‚Äò%‚Äô in the string argument is the number of additional arguments
      the ~printf~ takes.

* Conditionals & Assertion-Based Testing

  In C, /true ‚âà non-zero/.
  Form of the conditional:
  \vspace{-0.5em}
#+BEGIN_SRC C
if (condition)
  statementBlock
// The rest is optional.
else
  statementBlock
  #+END_SRC
  \vspace{-0.5em}
+ ~condition~ is /any/ expression that returns a numeric value:
  All numbers are treated as ‚Äòtrue‚Äô, except 0 which is considered ‚Äòfalse‚Äô.
  # - Ex, ~while(1) S~ means repeat ~S~ /forever/, or as much as possible.

  #+begin_center org
/Asserts are essentially compile-checked comments of user intentions!/
#+end_center

~assert(e)~ does nothing when expression ~e~ is true; otherwise it gives a message
showing the filename, function name, line number, and the condition ~e~ that
failed to be true.
# It is a macro defined in <assert.h>.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>

// Disable assertions at compile time by enabling NODEBUG.
// #define NDEBUG

#include <assert.h>
// assert(n)  ‚âà  if (n) {} else ‚ü™Terminate and display error message‚ü´

int sum(int n)
{
  int total = 0, i = 0;
  while (i != n + 1)
    total += i, i++;

  return total;
}

int main ()
{
  // print-based testing
  if (1) printf("here"); else printf("there");
  printf("Sum of 0 + 1 + ‚ãØ + 99 + 100 = %d", sum(100));

  // assertion-based testing
  assert( sum(100) == 5050 );
  assert( (1 ? "here" : "there") == "here" );

  // Is completely ignored if the #define is enabled.
  // assert(0);  // Otherwise, this causes a crash.

  return 0;
}

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We see the results alongside writing a function, without having to form a ~main~
just to check these tests.

* Assignments

#+BEGIN_SRC C

  --x      ‚âà  x -= 1
#+END_SRC

The increment and decrement, ~++/--~, operators may precede or follow a name:

+ If they follow a name, then their behaviour is executed /after/ the smallest context
  ---e.g., braces or conditional parentheses--- in which they occur.

+ When they precede a name, their behaviour is executed before the context in which
  they appear.

+ The order of evaluation is not specified inside a function call and so behaviour
  varies between compilers.

*Avoid using these in complex expressions, unless you know what you're doing.*

* Loops

  Here's the general form.
#+BEGIN_SRC C
while (condition)
  statementBlock

/* Abbreviations */
/* for      loop */   for(A; B; C;) S  ‚âà  A; while(B) S
/* do-while loop */   do S while B     ‚âà  S; while(B) S
#+END_SRC

do/while: The conditional is evaluated /after/ the statement has been executed
and so the statement is obeyed at least once, regardless of the truth or falsity of
the condition. This is useful for /do once, and possible more/ operations.
#+BEGIN_SRC C
int i = 0;
do printf("%d \n", i++);
while (i != 10); //Note the ending semicolon.
#+END_SRC

* Arithmetic and Logic

#+begin_quote
/...and then the different branches of arithmetic ---Ambition, Distraction,

#+end_quote

The modulus operator ~%~ gives the /remainder/ of a division.
#+BEGIN_SRC C :exports none
printf("rem = 10 %% 3 = %d  ‚áí  ‚àÉ quot ‚Ä¢  10 = 3 √ó quot + rem  ‚àß  quot = %d", 10 % 3, 10 / 3);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: rem = 10 % 3 = 1  ‚áí  ‚àÉ quot ‚Ä¢  10 = 3 √ó quot + rem  ‚àß  quot = 3

+ In conditionals, one may see ~n % d~ to mean that ~n % d~ is true, i.e., is /non-zero/.
  This expresses that ~n~ is a /multiple/ of ~d~.

+ That is, numerically ~%~ yields remainders; but logically, in C, it expresses the
  is-multiple-of relationship.

When ~x~ is a number, the shift operations correspond to multiplication and
division by ~2‚Åø~, respectively.
| Left Shift  | ~x << n~ | append the bit representation of ~x~ with ~n~-many 0s             |
| Right Shift | ~x >> n~ | throw away ~n~ bits from the end of the bit representation of ~x~ |

The /bitwise/ operators /and ~&~, or ~|~, not ~!~,/ and /xor/ ~^~ operate at the bit representation
of an item. For example, the ASCII code of a character consists of 7 bits where
| _Bit_ | _Function_                            |
|   7 | 0 digit, 1 letter                   |
|   6 | 0 upper case, 1 digit or lower case |
|   5 | 0 for a-o, 1 for digit or p-z       |

Whence, to convert a character to uppercase it suffices to change bit 5 to be a 0
and leave the other bits alone. That is, to perform a bitwise /and/ with the binary
number /11011111/, which corresponds to the decimal number 223.

* Floats & Other Types

 + float: Representing huge numbers to tiny fractions.
 + double: Like float, but greater precision.
 + int: The integers; it has 2 /subtypes/; namely short, long, and unsigned.
   - Short and long allocate less (half) or more (twice) memory, respectively.
   - Unsigned means we omit negative numbers, and therefore have twice as many
     non-negative numbers since the sign is no longer a necessary place-holder.
     * Also useful when negative integers are unreasonable for the current task.

* Forming Numbers using Octal & Hexadecimal

Numbers that begin with a 0 are interpreted as octal and those beginning with 0x or 0X
are hexadecimal. These forms are obtained from binary by grouping using 3 bits
and 4 bits, respectively. E.g., ~129 ‚âà 0201 ‚âà 0x81~ since:

+ 129 ‚Üí‚ü®binary‚ü© 10 000 001 ‚Üí‚ü®octal‚ü© 2 0 1
+ 129 ‚Üí‚ü®binary‚ü© 1000 0001  ‚Üí‚ü®hexadecimal‚ü© 8 1

Indeed:
#+BEGIN_SRC C :exports both
int x = 129, y = 0201, z = 0x81, zz = 0X81, b = (x == y) && (x == zz);
printf("%d ‚âà %d ‚âà %d; %d", x, y, z, b);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 129 ‚âà 129 ‚âà 129; 1

* The Preprocessor

  The preprocessor performs alterations to a program /before/ it is compiled; e.g.,
  the following ensures the replacement of every occurrence of ~this(‚ãØ, ‚ãØ)~ after it with
  whatever ~that~ is.
  #+BEGIN_SRC C
#define this(arg1, arg2)  that
#+End_SRC

  + All preprocessor commands are preceded by the ~#~ symbol.

  + One generally defines useful constants or abbreviations this way, and if they have
    a collection of such parameters or utilities in some file, then they can
    /copy-paste/ them into the current program file by using ~#include~ as mentioned
     before.

* Pointers

  + A fly is a bug that flies; so a /fly flies/.
  + Likewise, a /pointer points/.

Variables may be used without having values declared!
This is akin to buying the land ---computer memory--- but not building the house
---assigning a value--- thereby leaving us with a vacant lot that contains trees, garbage,
and whatever was there before you get there ---as is the case in C.
# C is our middle-man to the real-estate agent, the operating system.
#+BEGIN_SRC C :includes <assert.h>
char c;
int i;
long x;
float f;
double d;

// Uninitalised ‚áí have random values.

printf("char   %c\n",c);
printf("int    %i\n",i);
printf("long   %l\n",x);
printf("float  %f\n",f);
printf("double %d\n",d);
#+END_SRC

#RESULTS:
| char   |      |
| int    | 32766 |
| long   |       |
| float  |   0.0 |
| double | 73896 |

Rather than being set to 0, variables automatically obtain the random values in memory and
one should always initialise variables upon declaration.

+ The amount of space a variable needs is its /size/ in memory.
+ The actual location of the variable in memory is called its /address/ ---just like the
  address on your house or on an ugly vacant lot.

0. In your computer, memory space is measured in bytes.
   - Not every computer uses the same storage space for its variables.
   - The ~sizeof~ keyword tells us how many bytes a variable, or structure, uses up.
     + Both sizeof(x) and sizeof(int) are valid calls.
   - This keyword is used primarily for manual allocation of memory for new variables
     we create.

     #+BEGIN_SRC C :includes <assert.h>
char c;
int i;
long x;
float f;
double d;

// Uninitalised ‚áí have random values.

printf("char   %i\n",sizeof(c));
printf("int    %i\n",sizeof(i));
printf("‚Ñ§      %i\n",sizeof(int));
printf("long   %i\n",sizeof(x));
printf("float  %i\n",sizeof(f));
printf("double %i\n",sizeof(d));

#define Length 123
#define Type   char
Type arr[Length];

assert( sizeof(arr) == sizeof(Type) * Length );
#+END_SRC

1. Memory is set aside for variables, even if they're not used.
   - To avoid hogging up excess memory, programs that need a lot of memory usually
     request it a little at a time using ~malloc~ ---‚Äòm‚Äôemory ‚Äòalloc‚Äôation.

2. C is a mid-level language that has the capability to examine memory and the variables
  stored there.

3. Why care about /where/ variables are located in memory?

   Consider sorting an array of complex data, rather than moving the data itself
   around, it is much cheaper to simply sort an array corresponding to their numeric
   locations in memory.

   - The variables that hold addresses are called /pointers/.

4. A variable consists of 4 pieces: Name, type, size, and location in memory.
   - The first two we know, since we write them down.
   - The third is obtained via the ~sizeof~ operator.
   - The fourth is obtained by using the ‚Äúaddress of‚Äù operator ~&~, resulting
     in a pointer. ( One may think of ‚Äò&‚Äô as simply projecting the fourth component
     from a variable structure. )

   /A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address./

   - Pointers are represented as numeric locations, but they are not number values.

6. ~T*~ is denotes pointers of type ~T~.

   - Pointers are declared like any other variable.
   - Conventionally a declaration looks like ~T *t;~ ---the whitespace around the ‚Äò*‚Äô is
     completely irrelevant--- as a reminder that the expression ~*t~ denotes a value of
     type ~T~. Huh?
     + Without ‚Äò*‚Äô, pointers consume and represent memory locations.
     + With ‚Äò*‚Äô, they denote a value of type ~T~.

     Unless you're working with pointers to pointers, you do not want
     to write down ~*p = &x~, which sets the /value/ at the location of ~p~ to refer to an /address/.
#+BEGIN_SRC C :includes <assert.h>
// Valid declarations
int*p;
int* q;
int *r;
int * s;

printf("p is location %u \n", p);

char arr[] = "hello";
p = &arr; p = &arr[0]; p = arr;
printf("p is location %u \n", p);

// For arrays, the array name and the address of the array both refer to the address
// of the zeroth element.
assert( &arr    == arr );
assert( &arr[0] == arr );
#+END_SRC

1. Here's some useful conversion laws
   - *&-inverses ::  ~p = &x  ‚â°  *p = x~
     + The lhs lives in the land of addresses and locations,
       whereas the rhs lives in the land of values.

   - []&-array ::  ~arr + i = &arr[i]~

   From these we obtain:
   - []*-array :: ~*(arr + i) = arr[i]~  ---immediate from the above two laws.
   - *-array :: ~*arr = arr[0]~  ---immediate from the above two laws.
   - ***-array :: ~**arr = arr[0][0]~ ---the previous law iterated twice.

Tips:
| ‚úì | Pointers must be declared with the asterisk                                      |
| ‚úì | When a pointer is used without its asterisk, it refers to a memory location      |
| ‚úì | When a pointer is used with its asterisk, it indirectly refers to a value        |
| ‚úì | To assign a pointer a memory location, prefix the other variable with &          |
| ‚úì | Pointers are memory addresses and can be displayed as unsigned integers using ~%u~ |

** Pointer initialisation

 #+BEGIN_SRC C :exports both
int a[30], *p;

// Make p point to the beginning of the array a, since a is itself a pointer to the
// beginning of the array.
p = a;

// Determine the actual machine address of a variable by predicing it with &.
int fred;
p = &fred;

// If we need to know exactly where in the machine C had decidede to allocate space
// to fred, we need only to print out p; whence & is read ‚Äúaddress of‚Äù.
printf("%p", p);

 Since the name of an array is itself a pointer to the beginning of an array, we have
 | arr ‚âà &arr[0] |

 #+BEGIN_SRC C :includes <assert.h>
// Find furthest points of ‚Äòint a[N-1]‚Äô that are identical.
#define N 12
int a[] = {9,8,1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1,7,6};

int * p = a, *q = &a[N-1];
while(*p != *q) p++, q--;

assert(*p == a[2] && *q == a[9]);

 Before C99, function return types could be omitted with the understanding that the
 default is ~int~. However, ~main~ still needs its return type. The following works with
 many warnings.
 #+BEGIN_SRC C :includes <assert.h> :exports both
f() {return 9; }
g() {return 'c'; } // Remember that chars are actually numbers.

int main() { printf("%d", f() + g()); return 0; }

* Arrays and Strings and Things
+ C arrays are homogeneous ---all elements are of the same type---
  and their size is static ---one cannot readily change how many elements they contain.
+ ~T name[N]~ ‚áí Declares ~name~ to be an array of type ~T~ consisting of ~N~ elements.
  - In an initialisation, ~N~ may be omitted and is then inferred.
    * E.g., ~int a[] = {2, 4, 6};~
    * E.g., ~T a[N] = {x0, ..., xM}~ for ~M < N~ initialises the first ~M~ elements and the
      remaining ~N - M~ are uninitialised, and may consist of random junk.

+ Array access and modification is done with square brackets: ~arr[int_expression]~
  may be treated as a normal variable wherever it occurs.

:Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
// int [] a  ‚áí  crashes!

int a [] = {9, 7, 3};
int b[3] = {4, 2, 1};

printf("%d", b[1]);

int c[10] = {3, 22, 9};

+ Multi-dimensional arrays: ~T arr[d1][d2]...[dN]~.

  - Just as chars are numbers, multi-dimensional arrays are plain one-dimensional arrays:
    The multiple-dimension declaration syntax simply tells the compiler how to organise
    the array into (nested) groups and the indexing tells it which (nested) group
    we're interested in working with.

#+BEGIN_SRC C :includes <assert.h>

+ The uppercase letters start at ASCII code 65 and lowercase start at code 97.
+ The compiler sees all characters as numbers.

** Strings, Arrays, and Pointers

   + The idea of a pointer is central to the C programming philosophy.
     - It is pointers to strings, rather than strings themselves, that're passed around
       in a C program.

   + C strings like ~s = "this"~ actually, under the hood, are /null-terminated
     arrays of characters/: The name ~s~ refers to the /address of/ the first character, the ~'t'~,
     with the array being ~'t' ‚Üí 'h' ‚Üí 'i' ‚Üí 's' ‚Üí ùüò~, where ùüò is /not/ ASCII zero
     ---whose value is 48--- but ASCII /null/ ---i.e., all bits set to 0.

     - Note that null ùüò is denoted by ~'\0'~ and has /value/ 0, i.e., false, so
       conditions of the form ~p != '\0'~ are the same as ~p~.

   + /An array name is a pointer to the beginning of the array./
     - Yet, an array name is a constant and you can't do arithmetic with it.

 #+BEGIN_SRC C :exports both
int length(char c[]) // A string is a character array
{
  // While c[l] is not an ASCII null, keep counting until.
  int l = 0;
  while( c[l] ) l++;
  return l;
}

int main()
{
  char str[] = "hello world 0123";
  printf("length(‚Äú%s‚Äù) = %d", str, length(str));
   return 0;
}
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 : length(‚Äúhello world 0123‚Äù) = 16

   + ~T *p;~ ‚áí declare ~p~ to be a pointer to elements of type ~T~.
   + ~*p = v~ ‚áí ‚Äúput the value of ~v~ in the location which ~p~ points to‚Äù

 We can now rewrite the length function with even less square brackets.
 #+BEGIN_SRC C  :main no :includes '(\"/Users/musa/CCheatSheet/myassert.h\")
int length(char* c)
{
  char* start = c;
  while( *c ) c++; // Local copy of c is affected.
  return c - start;
}

  char * p = cs;
  while(keep_reading && p < cs + BUFFER_LENGTH)
    {*p = getchar(); if (*p == '\n') keep_reading = 0; else p++;}

  ,*p = '\0'; // Strings are a null-terminated arrays of chars.
